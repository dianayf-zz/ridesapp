# RidesApp

Is a ride-hailing service, developed in Ruby with Sinatra. For storage it's includes files configuration to access a relational database in Postgresql and Sequel as ORM.

As any ride service you can request a ride and perform some additonal functions, like create monetary transaction to pay for a ride, add payment source via an external plattform [WOMPI](https://docs.wompi.co/docs/en-us/inicio-rapido).

letâ€™s see more detail in next sections.

## Getting Started

According to general purpose you need to configure and follows next steps

### Configuration and Prerequisites

- Needs Ruby 2.7 version
- Postgres instalation --actual version 10
- Create an .env file that includes

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://host/database_name?user=user&password=password
   ```

### Instalation

  - Clone project from with ssh git@github.com:dianayf/ridesapp.git
  - Due, we use postgres adapter, you need to create first database before run project
  - Install bundler gem
  - Run bundle install
  - Run migrations bundle exec rake db:migrate
  - Populate database with seed task, run bundle exec rake db:seed
 

  - Locally you can set enviroment with dotenv gem in that case uses next command:
     ```
    dotenv -f ".env" rackup config.ru
     ```
### Run app
  You can specify port to run project in command, Sinatra uses by default by port 9292, so run next command and check your localhost: 
   ```
   bundle exec rackup -p 9292 config.ru
   ```
   Check localhost:9292 and server should be already up!

### WOMPI Configuration

The following endpoints require that you previous create a [WOMPI](https://docs.wompi.co/docs/en-us/inicio-rapido) account and add to your .env file next variables.

- Notes:

- Sandbox mode should be activate to avoid real money transactions, for current purpose this app uses WOMPI API in that mode. 
- Any money transaction by default uses credit card as payment method and ridesApp set installments number to 2.
- RidesApp don't storage any sensitive data as credit card information, so by default it's uses a tokenized card previouslly as you see in "TOKENIZE_CARD" variable.
   ```
   WOMPI_PUBLIC_KEY=public_key
   WOMPI_PRIVATE_KEY=priv_key
   WOMPI_BASE_URL=https://sandbox.wompi.co/v1
   TOKENIZE_CARD=tok_test_1430_A716Efe5D9DEDf2De6906212c08e73e0
   ```
